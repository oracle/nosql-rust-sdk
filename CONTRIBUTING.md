# Contributing to the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service Rust SDK

*Copyright (c) 2024, 2025 Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.*

The target readers of this document are those who want to contribute to the
Oracle NoSQL Database Rust SDK project, including but not limited to contributing
to the source code, examples, tests and documents.

## Before contributing

### Sign the OCA

Before you become a contributor, please read and sign
[Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA](OCA),
see [Contributing](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-rust-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more details.

After you signed the OCA, make sure that your Git tool is configured to create
commits using the name and e-mail address you used to sign the OCA:
You can configure Git globally (or locally as you prefer) with the commands:
```bash
git config --global user.email you@example.com
git config --global user.name YourName
```

### Check the issue tracker

When you find any issues with the Rust SDK or want to propose a change, please
check the [Issues](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-rust-sdk/issues) page
first, this helps prevent duplication of effort. If the issue is already being
tracked, feel free to participate in the discussion.

### Opening issues

If you find an issue that is not tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-rust-sdk/issues)
page, feel free to open a new one, describe the issue, discuss your plans or
proposed changes.
All contributions should be connected to an issue except for the trivial changes.

## Contributing Code

Follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when you
work on a change for Rust SDK.

Before you open a pull request, make sure:
- Add unit tests for the code changes you made.
- Use `cargo fmt` to format the code.
- Run all tests.
  - It is important to run all tests and make sure they pass with both the
Oracle NoSQL Cloud Simulator and the Oracle NoSQL Database (on-premise).
If you have a subscription to the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service, it would
be great if you can run the tests with the Cloud Service as well.

## Run Tests

### Run tests with the Oracle NoSQL Cloud Simulator

### Run tests with Oracle NoSQL Database on-premise

## Run Examples

See the [Examples](https://github.com/oracle/nosql-rust-sdk#examples) section.

## Pull Request Process

Pull requests can be made under
[Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA](OCA).

For pull requests to be accepted, the bottom of
your commit message must have the following line using your name and
e-mail address as it appears in the OCA Signatories list.

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with:

```
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having
signed the OCA can be accepted.
